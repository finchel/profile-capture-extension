## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "Extension failed to capture"
**Solutions**:
1. Refresh the page and try again
2. Check if profile is fully loaded
3. Verify site is LinkedIn or Google Contacts
4. Check browser console for errors

### Issue: "Downloads not organizing properly"
**Solutions**:
1. Check Chrome download settings
2. Ensure download permission granted
3. Verify folder structure in Downloads

### Issue: "Screenshot is blank"
**Solutions**:
1. Check if tab is active and visible
2. Ensure no browser restrictions on screenshots
3. Try scrolling to top of page before capture

### Issue: "Missing profile data"
**Solutions**:
1. LinkedIn frequently changes selectors - update content.js
2. Ensure profile is public/accessible
3. Check if page finished loading

## Performance Metrics

**Expected Performance**:
- Capture time: 2-8 seconds depending on page size
- File sizes: 
  - HTML: 100KB - 2MB
  - JSON: 1-10KB  
  - Screenshot: 200KB - 1MB
- Storage: ~3-5MB per profile capture

## Security Considerations

- Extension only accesses specified domains
- No data transmitted externally
- All storage is local to browser
- Downloads saved to user's default folder
- No sensitive permissions beyond necessary scope

## Professional Recommendations

### Data Quality Optimization
1. **Regular Selector Updates**: LinkedIn changes their DOM structure frequently. Schedule monthly reviews of extraction selectors.

2. **Enhanced Error Recovery**: Add retry mechanisms for transient capture failures.

3. **Validation Layer**: Implement data validation to flag potentially incomplete captures.

### Scalability Considerations
1. **Batch Processing**: For high-volume usage, consider adding batch capture capabilities.

2. **Cloud Sync**: Evaluate cloud storage integration for cross-device access.

3. **Export Formats**: Add CSV/Excel export for business analysis tools.

**Final Professional Assessment**: This extension provides robust profile capture functionality with proper error handling and organized file management. The architecture is scalable and the testing suite ensures reliability. The main limitation is LinkedIn's dynamic DOM structure requiring periodic maintenance.

**Recommendation**: Deploy with monthly maintenance schedule for selector updates and quarterly feature reviews based on usage patterns.
